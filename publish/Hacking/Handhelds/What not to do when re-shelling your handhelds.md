On the motherboard, there are 2 types of ZIF connectors, one where you aren't supposed to pull up the tab and the other where you aren't supposed to. 

I am, of course, talking about these things:

If you see these when taking down components, you **gently** pull on the ribbon cable. 

The telltale sign that you screwed up is the console booting up BUT after few seconds there is a slight *pop* sound and it's back to the land of dead. The problem is that the pins aren't pressing down hard enough for a proper connection and that results in no/lossy signal from the component.

In the unfortunate case like I did your options are:
- Cry over your mistakes (0/10, not all that fun)
- (Hot) glue it down (1/10 it may work, but ew)
- Buy a new motherboard (6/10 pricy, but less work and not as pricy as another 3DS XL)
- Buy a new connector  (10/10 pain but it's worth it)
	- (look up - FA1004SA1-R8000)
	- Careful with the soldering, these will be quite the pain to solder on.
