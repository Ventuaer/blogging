All of these handhelds are hacked unless mentioned otherwise! 
## $\Upsilon$ "Upsilon" - 3DS 
![[Pasted image 20250701182754.png]]
This one is the first of my 3DS console collection. After this one, I wanted more. 

## $\Lambda$ "Lambda" - New 3DS LL 
![[Pasted image 20250701183040.png]]
This one is also from Japan, though, this time it's bigger, 

## $\delta$ "Delta" - 3DS
> Yes, I know that's an uppercase letter and hence the name should be delta. Shoo.

All of these consoles share a theme with the symbols being different on each console. Some of the visible themes are placeholders. 

## $\theta$ "Theta" - New 3DS LL 
![[Pasted image 20250701184121.png]]
This one is currently screwed up and should be fixed as soon as possible. See [[What not to do when re-shelling your handhelds]]. 
I am hoping to fix it in the near future. 

BTW, dear reader, did you figure out the theme yet? :^) 

## $O$ "Omicron" - DS Lite

This used to a basic white old DSL but after re-shelling it (and fighting some of the ribbon cables to make it function again) it booted up just fine. 
In all honesty, I bought this DSL and the shell from Extremerate as I wanted this exact transparent shell from one post. I love it to bits and pieces. 

## $\uptau$ "Tau" - DS Lite

Currently no view of it, as it's screen's ribbon cable is in shambles and waiting for replacement. 
It has a usb C mod: ![[Pasted image 20250701190420.png]]
Gracefully yoinked design :}. 

## $A$ "Alpha" - Switch Lite
![[Pasted image 20250701190616.png]]
Originally a light blue Switch lite, with a modchip neatly (soon to be) installed:

This one went to me from a second hand, it was marketed as "Junk item", due to the left joystick not working. I found out it was simply due to the fact, that the shell under it has some broken parts, mainly around the left joystick. While the console was looking a bit dirty, it was mostly okay in the end. Installing the modchip was quite fun.
